First, read `config/bootcamp_progress.json` and check the `current_module` field. If the current module is NOT 11, do nothing — let the conversation continue normally. If the current module IS 11, do the following:

Display a clear packaging-complete summary:

📦  PACKAGING PHASE COMPLETE — PHASE GATE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Everything from the packaging phase is done:
✅ Code containerized (Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml)
✅ Multi-environment config (dev/staging/prod)
✅ CI/CD pipeline configured
✅ Pre-deployment checklist verified
✅ Rollback plan documented

⚠️  Nothing has been deployed. No changes were made to any
    target environment. Everything so far was local
    preparation work. It is completely safe to stop here.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Then ask: "Ready to deploy now, or prefer to stop here and deploy later on your own?"

WAIT for the bootcamper's response. Do NOT proceed to any deployment steps (Steps 13–15) until the bootcamper explicitly says they want to deploy.
